Include the CSS animation styles definition, we strongly recomend you to use the amazing [animate.css library](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) as starting point, this library provides beautiful animations. Also, you can define your own animations.

```xml
<head>
    <!-- Animate.css library -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/animatecss/3.1.0/animate.css">
</head>
```
