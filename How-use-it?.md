#### 1. **Include the anijs library:**

 ```html
 <script src="anijs-min.js"></script>
 ```

#### 2. **Include an auxiliar stylesheet with the animations that you will need:**

For example in our case:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="animate.css">
```

#### 3. Play with data-anijs tag:
```html
<p data-anijs="if: click, on:h1, do: pulse animated, to:h2"></p>
```

<u>Lets make a little more closer look...
</u>

First, you must decide: **What I want my page to Do?**

and for that you may begin deciding:

 * Which ***Event*** you want to capture, interact or response on.

 * Which ***Html Elements*** you need to modify or animate.

 * Which ***Actions or Animations*** you want happening over those elements.


Good!, now, using those elements... **How write the anijs setence?**

You can try by completing with those previous elements the next fragment:

 **If:** <u>  *Event(click, scroll, mouseover and more)*  </u>, **On:** <u>  *Html element (css selector)*  </u>, **Do:** <u>  *Actions or Animations (Rotate animation)*  </u>, **To:** <u>  *Html element to modify*  </u>

and Finally copy the sentence into some html element like the next example.

```html
<p data-anijs="if: click, on:h1, do: pulse animated, to:h2"></p>
```

That's all! but you can play with anijs sentence a lot of more, keep looking around this site, you'll find more details and more examples, more versatility for amaze, and a lot of fun in the meantime.
